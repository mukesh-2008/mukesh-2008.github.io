      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Rooted in fundamentals. Growing with purpose.</p>

      <p>
        My name is Mukesh, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology
        in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I believe in learning
        technology the right way—by understanding the basics deeply and
        building skills step by step.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not someone who rushes toward trends or shortcuts. I prefer slow,
        steady progress that creates a strong foundation. For me, consistency,
        discipline, and clarity matter more than quick results.

    <!-- Mindset -->
    <section>
      <h2>My Mindset</h2>

      <p>
        I strongly believe that true growth happens when effort becomes a habit.
        I value patience, self-improvement, and honest learning over external
        validation. Mistakes are part of the process, and I treat them as lessons
        rather than failures.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy learning by doing—experimenting, building small projects, and
        improving them over time. This mindset helps me stay grounded while
        continuously pushing myself forward.

      <h2>Academics & Interests</h2>

      <p>
        As an AI & Data Science student, I am focused on strengthening my core
        understanding of programming, logic, and data-driven thinking. I am
        currently working on web development fundamentals alongside Python and
        introductory AI concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I am also interested in creativity, structured
        thinking, and effective communication. I believe that a good engineer
        must also be a clear thinker and a responsible communicator.

        and move one step closer to becoming a skilled and dependable
        professional.
