  <h1>Hi, I'm Mukesh 👋</h1>
  <h2>AI & Data Science Student</h2>

  <p>
    I’m a first-year B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science,
    driven by curiosity, discipline, and a strong belief in learning things the
    right way. I value fundamentals, consistency, and meaningful progress over
    shortcuts and hype.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that real growth comes from patience and daily effort. Instead of
    rushing to look perfect, I focus on understanding concepts deeply and
    applying them step by step through practical work.
  </p>

  <h1>My Learning Journey</h1>

  <p>
    My journey into technology started with a strong interest in computers,
    problem-solving, and creativity. Over time, this interest evolved into a
    clear goal: to build a solid career in Artificial Intelligence and Data
    Science.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently strengthening my foundation in programming and web
    development while gradually exploring the core concepts of AI and data
    science. I believe that mastering the basics today will help me handle
    complex systems tomorrow.
  </p>

  <h1>What I’m Focused On</h1>

  <p>
    I am actively learning and practicing the following skills, with a strong
    emphasis on clarity and correctness:
  </p>

  <p>✔ HTML & CSS for structured and clean web design</p>
  <p>✔ JavaScript basics for logic and interactivity</p>
  <p>✔ Python for problem-solving and data-related tasks</p>
  <p>✔ Core fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</p>

  <p>
    Alongside technical skills, I am also working on improving my communication
    and presentation abilities, as I believe strong communication is essential
    for long-term professional success.
  </p>

  <h1>Projects & Practical Work</h1>

  <p>
    This portfolio website is my first complete project. It represents my
    willingness to start from scratch, learn by doing, and improve continuously.
    Every section of this website reflects my current understanding and effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I grow, I plan to add more projects related to web development, data
    analysis, and artificial intelligence, each one marking a step forward in
    my learning journey.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:40px 0; border-color:#1e293b;">

  <h1>My Vision</h1>

  <p>
    My long-term goal is to become a skilled professional in the field of AI and
    Data Science, capable of building solutions that are useful, ethical, and
    impactful. I aspire to work in challenging environments that encourage
    innovation, responsibility, and continuous learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I strongly believe that success is not built overnight. It is the result of
    discipline, patience, and the courage to keep going even when progress feels
    slow. This portfolio is just the beginning of that journey.
