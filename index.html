      <h2>AI & Data Science Student</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a first-year B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science,
        driven by curiosity, discipline, and a strong belief in learning things the
        right way. I focus on fundamentals, consistency, and meaningful progress
        rather than shortcuts or hype.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe real growth comes from patience and daily effort. Instead of
        rushing to look perfect, I concentrate on understanding concepts deeply
        and applying them step by step through practical work.

      <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>

      <p>
        My journey into technology started with a natural interest in computers,
        problem-solving, and creativity. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a
        clear goal: building a strong and ethical career in Artificial Intelligence
        and Data Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently strengthening my foundation in programming and web
        development while gradually exploring core AI and data science concepts.
        I believe mastering the basics today prepares me to handle complex
        systems tomorrow.

      <h2>What I’m Focused On</h2>

      <p>
        I am actively learning and practicing the following skills with a strong
        emphasis on clarity, correctness, and long-term value:
      </p>

      <ul class="focus-list">
        <li>✔ HTML & CSS for clean, structured web design</li>
        <li>✔ JavaScript fundamentals for logic and interactivity</li>
        <li>✔ Python for problem-solving and data-related tasks</li>
        <li>✔ Core concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Alongside technical skills, I am also improving my communication and
        presentation abilities, as I believe strong communication is essential
        for long-term professional success.

      <h2>Projects & Practical Work</h2>

      <p>
        This portfolio website is my first complete project. It represents my
        willingness to start from scratch, learn by doing, and improve
        continuously. Every section reflects my current understanding and effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I grow, I plan to add more projects related to web development,
        data analysis, and artificial intelligence—each one marking a step
        forward in my learning journey.

    <!-- Vision -->
    <section>
      <h2>My Vision</h2>

      <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a skilled professional in AI and Data
        Science, capable of building solutions that are useful, ethical, and
        impactful. I aspire to work in challenging environments that encourage
        innovation, responsibility, and continuous learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I strongly believe success is not built overnight. It is the result of
        discipline, patience, and the courage to keep going even when progress
        feels slow. This portfolio is just the beginning.
